    "A general adversarial net is made of 2 models, a discriminator and a generator. The discriminator's goal is to tell whether an image is from the data set or not (it will output a scalar with its confidence). While the generator takes random noise as an input it tries to fool the discriminator.\n",
    "\n",
    "They both are optimized to get better at their individual tasks using back propagation and dropout algorithms. To prevent overfitting, during runtime the optimization of the generator and discriminator are not done all at once. Optimization follows the pattern k steps for discriminator for every 1 step for the generator. This keeps the generator near its optimal solution all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting generator can make images with the capacity to fool the discriminator. Thus creating realistic images from the noise."
